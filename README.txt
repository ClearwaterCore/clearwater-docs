A	Third Party Software Attributions

The following third party components are included with Project Clearwater, and are made

information regarding the authors and copyright holders are provided along with the 
applicable source files included in this distribution.


A.1	ACE
Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), 
and CoSMIC(TM)
ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE>(TM), and CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth 
referred to as "DOC software") are copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and 
his research group at Washington University, University of California, Irvine, 
and Vanderbilt University, Copyright (c) 1993-2009, all rights reserved. Since DOC 
software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, 
and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software source code and object 
code produced from the source, as well as copy and distribute modified versions of this 
software. You must, however, include this copyright statement along with any code built 
using DOC software that you release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if 
you just ship binary executables of your software products.
You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are 
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using DOC 
software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, 
such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a 
way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source 
development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in 
your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your 
project in the DOC software success stories.
The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC 
Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for 
Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development 
of open-source software as part of the open-source software community. Submissions 
are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever, including any 
warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or 
fitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct, 
indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including without 
limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, 
DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties 
of design, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or 
arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC 
Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with 
respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC 
software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC 
Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be liable for any lost 
revenue or profits or other special, indirect and consequential damages.
DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of 
Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to 
assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A number of 
companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. 
DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-
compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule 
passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005," which established new 
daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 
2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and calendaring information from 
operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they 
upgrade their operating systems accordingly.
The names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), CoSMIC(TM), Washington 
University, UC Irvine, and Vanderbilt University, may not be used to endorse or 
promote products or services derived from this source without express written 
permission from Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University. This 
license grants no permission to call products or services derived from this source 
ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), or CoSMIC(TM), nor does it grant 
permission for the name Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University to

      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
